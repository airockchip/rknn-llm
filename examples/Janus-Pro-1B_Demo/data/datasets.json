Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nMadelyn applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of her snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Tucker timed each ride. Madelyn and Tucker calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.\nFigure: snowboarding down a hill.\nQuestion: Identify the question that Madelyn and Tucker's experiment can best answer.\nOptions:\nA. Does Madelyn's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a thin layer of wax or a thick layer of wax?\nB.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nLaura and Isabella were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Laura and Isabella's test show?\nOptions:\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "target":"B"},

    {"image_path": "data/datasets", "image": "448.jpg", "input": "Hint: Read the text.\nButterflies and moths are easily mistaken for each other, but one distinction between them often appears during their pupal stage. When most butterfly caterpillars reach full size, they attach themselves to a leaf or other object and shed their skin a final time, forming a chrysalis, a hard, shell-like skin, which protects the pupa inside. The chrysalis may be dull and rough or shiny and smooth, usually blending into its surroundings. Most moth caterpillars, by contrast, create a cocoon to protect the pupa, rather than forming a chrysalis. The cocoons usually resemble hard silk pouches, but some moths also incorporate materials like hairs and twigs.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. cocoon\nB. chrysalis\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "target":"B"},
    {"image_path": "data/datasets", "image": "477.jpg", "input": "Hint: Read the text.\nHeat transfer can occur in different ways. Two common ways are through conduction and convection. Conduction occurs when molecules from one object collide with molecules from another object. Burning your hand by touching a hot car door on a sunny summer day is an example of conduction.\nConvection is another form of heat transfer. When a liquid or gas is heated, the heated matter rises upward, away from the heat source. Hot bubbles rising in a pot of water boiling on a stove is an example of convection.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. conduction\nB. convection\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "target":"B"},
